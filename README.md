Objective

This Splunk Lab project was created to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a SIEM, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios.  
Skills Learned

Example below.

Spin up TWO VM's with the network adapter set to the Internal Network setting while making both VM IP's static to the same network, I selected this network scheme for security purposes because I do not want these VM's routing to the internet while still being able to communicate with eachother.
The IP's in this lab are: Windows box - 192.168.33.2, Kali box - 192.168.33.3
